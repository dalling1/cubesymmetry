# cubesymmetry

Drag-and-drop relabelling of a cube to show symmetries.  Labels are moved from one copy of a cube to 
another.

Neighbour constraints are enforced: only the first label to be moved can be placed anywhere. 
Subsequent labels must obey the neighbour relationships from the original cube.
